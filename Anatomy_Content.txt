Human Anatomy 
Human anatomy is the study of the structure of the human body. It helps us understand what body parts we have, where they are located, and how they work together to keep the body healthy.
The human body is divided into head and neck, trunk (chest and abdomen), and limbs (arms and legs). Inside the body, there are bones, muscles, and organs arranged in an organized way. Muscles help in movement, bones give support and shape, and organs perform important functions like breathing, digestion, and blood circulation.
Studying human anatomy helps us understand body movement, daily activities, health, and diseases. Here are some of the muscle working system :
1. Deltoid Muscle
The deltoid is a muscle of the shoulder.
It helps us raise, lower, and rotate the arm.
It also gives a rounded shape to the shoulder.
2. Sternocleidomastoid Muscle
This is a muscle of the neck.
 It helps us turn the head left and right and bend the head forward.
3. Pectoralis Major
The pectoralis major is a big muscle of the chest.
It helps in moving the arms forward, inward, and upward.
4. External Oblique Muscle
This muscle is present on the side of the abdomen.
It helps us twist the body and bend the body sideways.
5. Serratus Anterior
This muscle is found on the side of the ribs.
It helps in moving the shoulder blade and lifting the arm.
6. Sartorius Muscle
The sartorius is a long muscle of the thigh.
It helps in bending the knee and moving the leg.
7. Tibialis Anterior
This muscle is located in the front of the lower leg.
It helps in lifting the foot while walking or running.
8. Human Anatomy Model
This model shows the structure of the human body.
It helps us understand how muscles are placed and connected.
