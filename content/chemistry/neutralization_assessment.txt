MCQ
1. Why do factories prefer Magnesium Hydroxide over Sodium Hydroxide for treating acidic lake water?
A) It turns the water into a better fuel source.
B) Its low solubility prevents the pH from accidentally rising too high (over-alkalizing).
C) It is a liquid that dissolves faster than any other base.
D) It adds oxygen to the water for the fish to breathe.


2. As food moves from the stomach to the small intestine, the environment must shift from pH 2 to pH 8. What is the main reason for this neutralization?
A) To stop the food from moving too quickly.
B) To allow intestinal enzymes to function and prevent "burning" the intestine wall.
C) To help the body store more acid for later use.
D) To kill off all beneficial gut bacteria.


3. In nanomaterial synthesis, the exothermic nature of neutralization is its most valuable trait. What does this mean in a practical sense?
A) The reaction absorbs heat from the room to stay cold.
B) The reaction creates a vacuum.
C) The reaction releases the heat energy needed to transform metal precursors.
D) The reaction creates a magnetic field.

Fill in the Blanks
In a titration, you know neutralization is complete at the Equivalence Point, but you visually see this happen when the pH __________ changes color.

Farmers use Calcium Carbonate to treat "sour" soil because it neutralizes the acid and releases __________ gas as a byproduct.
Quick Check (Answers)
B (Safety—it won't "overshoot" the pH).
B (Enzyme activity and protection).
C (It provides the heat energy).
Indicator (like phenolphthalein).
Carbon dioxide (CO₂).
