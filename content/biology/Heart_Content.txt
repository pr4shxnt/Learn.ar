The Human Heart: Structure and Function

The human heart is a sophisticated, hollow, muscular organ that serves as the primary pump of the circulatory system. Derived from the embryonic mesoderm, it is roughly the size of a closed fist and is situated in the mediastinum of the thoracic cavity, positioned between the lungs and slightly tilted toward the left. It is a myogenic organ, meaning its rhythmic contractions are generated internally by specialized muscle fibers rather than external nerve impulses. By maintaining a continuous flow of blood through two distinct circuits, pulmonary and systemic, the heart ensures that oxygen and nutrients are delivered to every cell in the body while metabolic wastes like carbon dioxide are efficiently removed.
1. Structural Description of the Heart
The structure of the heart is specially designed to protect it, prevent blood mixing, and ensure efficient pumping.
Protective Coverings:
The heart is enclosed in a double-layered sac called the pericardium. The space between its two layers contains pericardial fluid, which acts as a lubricant. This fluid reduces friction during continuous heartbeats and also protects the heart from physical shock.

Heart Wall:
The heart wall has three layers. The outer epicardium provides protection. The middle myocardium is the thickest layer and is made of cardiac muscle; it is responsible for the powerful contractions of the heart. The inner endocardium forms a smooth lining inside the chambers, preventing blood from sticking to the walls.

Chambers and Septa:
The heart is divided into four chambers: two upper atria and two lower ventricles. The atria receive blood, while the ventricles pump blood out of the heart. Thick muscular walls called septa separate the right and left sides of the heart, ensuring that oxygenated and deoxygenated blood do not mix.

Valvular System:
 The heart contains four valves that maintain one-way blood flow. The tricuspid valve (right side) and mitral/bicuspid valve (left side) lie between the atria and ventricles. The semilunar valves at the openings of the aorta and pulmonary artery prevent blood from flowing back into the ventricles after contraction.
2. Functional Description of the Heart
The heart works like a powerful pump and also controls its own heartbeat. It does not need constant instructions from the brain to keep beating.
Control of Heartbeat (Conducting System):
The heartbeat begins at a special area called the Sinoatrial (SA) node, which acts as the heart’s natural pacemaker. It produces electrical signals that spread through the heart. These signals first cause the atria to contract, then pass to the Atrioventricular (AV) node and move through the Bundle of His and Purkinje fibers. This process makes the ventricles contract in a smooth and well-timed way, allowing blood to be pumped efficiently.
Double Circulation:
 The heart pumps blood through two separate pathways to keep the body healthy:
Pulmonary circulation: The right side of the heart sends oxygen-poor blood to the lungs, where it receives oxygen.


Systemic circulation: The left side of the heart sends oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body, supplying cells with oxygen and nutrients needed for energy.
Because of this coordinated pumping and circulation, the heart continuously supports all body functions.
Cardiac Cycle:
The cardiac cycle is the repeated process of the heart contracting and relaxing to pump blood. When the heart contracts, it is called systole, and this pushes blood out of the heart. When the heart relaxes, it is called diastole, and this allows the heart chambers to fill with blood. This regular rhythm of contraction and relaxation keeps blood moving continuously, ensuring that oxygen and nutrients reach all parts of the body efficiently.
